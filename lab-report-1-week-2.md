After VS Code is done installing, let's connect to the ieng6 server remotely through **ssh**. First, open VS Code and open up a terminal. Second, type "ssh cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu" into the terminal. The account above is an example account; make sure to replace that account with your account. Third, enter your account password to log in. Note that your password won't type out for security purposes.
